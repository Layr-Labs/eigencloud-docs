Read the following subsections before launching your new validator or integrating your existing validator. Before you deploy a new validator you must plan to either:
- Initially provision the withdrawal credentials to your EigenPod address.
- Initially provision the withdrawal credentials to an 0x00 address. You can then later modify your withdrawal credentials to your EigenPod address.
