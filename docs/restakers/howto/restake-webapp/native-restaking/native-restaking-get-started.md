:::warning
Read the following subsections before launching your new validator or integrating your existing validator. 

Before you deploy a new validator you must plan to either:
- Initially provision the withdrawal credentials to your EigenPod address.
- Initially provision the withdrawal credentials to an 0x00 address. You can then later modify your withdrawal credentials to your EigenPod address.

The diagram below outlines the operational flow of native restaking including: 
* Delegation 
* Redelegation (switching to a new Operator without exiting the validator)
* Yield handling options
* Exiting restaking.
