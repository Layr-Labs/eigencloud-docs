title: Restake and Delegate
---

:::tip
Restaking is depositing your tokens into EigenLayer contract. Delegating is assigning restaked assets to a specific 
Operator to run services for AVSs. For more information, refer to [Restaking Overview](../../../concepts/overview.md).
:::

The following procedure describes how to restake tokens except for natively staked ETH. For information on restaking natively
staked ETH, refer to [Native Restaking](../native-restaking/native-restaking-prerequisites).

To restake tokens using the [EigenLayer app](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/):

1. Open the [EigenLayer app](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/) and connect your Web3 wallet.
2. Click on the **Token** tab to view assets available for restaking.
3. Click on the asset you wish to restake. Choose the amount of the asset you wish to restake. Click **Submit** to continue.

:::info
If this is your first time depositing a token on EigenLayer, you'll need to **Approve** token spending before you can restake. [Token Approval](https://support.metamask.io/transactions-and-gas/transactions/what-is-a-token-approval) gives a dApp permission to move the specified token from your wallet.

4. If you have not yet delegated assets to an Operator, transaction prompts are displayed for the **Deposit** and **Delegate** transactions.
If you are currently delegated to an Operator, a transaction prompt is displayed for the **Deposit** transaction.
5. Sign the transaction (or transactions if you are also delegating) using your Web3 wallet. The confirmation screen is displayed
indicating that the Restake operation is completed.
