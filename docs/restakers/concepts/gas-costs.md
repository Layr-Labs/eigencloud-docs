## EigenPods

Where practical, we recommend users connect many validators to a single EigenPod to reduce cost and complexity. For each action 
requiring a checkpoint proof, the EigenLayer app batches up to 80 validators per proof transaction batch. Users with more 
validators require additional transactions to complete each checkpoint proof. Please plan your gas costs accordingly.

## Undelegating vs Unstaking

Unstaking and withdrawing requires less gas than Undelegating and withdrawing. To reduce gas costs, Undelegating is not 
required or recommended when withdrawing staked assets from EigenLayer.
