title: Unstaking and Withdrawing
---

Unstaking is the first step in the process of exiting restaked assets from EigenLayer. Unstaked tokens enter the withdrawal 
queue for the [escrow period](overview.md#escrow-period-withdrawal-delay). Withdrawing is the final step to move the tokens back to your wallet.
