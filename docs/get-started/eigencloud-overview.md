##  Cloud-scale Programmability, Crypto-grade Verifiability

EigenCloud is the unified platform vision for where EigenLayer is heading – a cohesive platform built to enable the next generation
of programmable, verifiable applications and agents. EigenCloud represents a shift from infrastructure as fragmented primitives
to a developer-first experience centered around programmable verifiability, cloud-scale coordination, and cryptoeconomic trust.

Today, building verifiable applications is hard. Developers must manually manage staking, operator coordination, slashing, and
economic incentives. Services are fragmented, tooling is underpowered, and integrations require deep protocol knowledge. For
builders who want to create high-performance, trust-minimized systems, this complexity is a blocker.

EigenCloud is our answer. It reimagines the developer experience around [EigenLayer](../products/eigenlayer/concepts/eigenlayer-overview.md), bundling together a suite of 1st party
verifiable services, such as [EigenDA](../products/eigenda/core-concepts/overview.md), [EigenCompute](../products/eigencompute/eigencompute-overview.md), and [EigenVerify](../products/eigenverify/eigenverify-overview.md) with new powerful developer tooling. This includes a
new CLI called DevKit for AVS and App developers, composable middleware and orchestration tools, unified billing and economic
incentives, and best-in-class onboarding and monitoring capabilities.These capabilities empower developers to go from idea to
deployment in days rather than months without needing to understand EigenLayer’s internals, enabling mainstream adoption of
verifiable infrastructure.

We're building EigenCloud for developers of Verifiable Apps. Each service or feature is tied to real user pain points, focused
on reducing friction, increasing adoption, and unlocking new value. As our 1st party and partner offerings expand, EigenCloud
will bundle them into out-of-the-box solutions on a unified developer platform.

This documentation includes both currently available and planned features. To understand which capabilities are live and what’s in development, 
refer to the [EigenCloud roadmap](eigencloud-roadmap.md). We update it regularly to reflect progress and timelines.
