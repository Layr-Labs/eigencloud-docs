# Executive Summary

Blazar (aka EigenDA V2) release is a comprehensive network upgrade bringing together variety of architectural updates along with more efficient bridging strategies, in order to make EigenDA more performant, robust, and user-friendly.

Blazar will have a massive impact on the system’s core performance parameters:

**Reduced confirmation latency**. Rollups that upgrade to the recommended integration strategies will see confirmation latencies reduced from several minutes to less than a minute. The near-term goal for Blazar is confirmation latencies of less than 10 seconds.

**Improved system throughput and stability**. Optimized network utilization in Blazar is expected to unlock substantial improvements to the capacity and stability of the decentralized EigenDA network.

Additionally, Blazar bundles features such as [consumer payments](../core-concepts/payments.md), which allow for permissionless usage of EigenDA by different applications.

## Motivation

Blazar addresses several performance and usability issues identified in the EigenDA core protocol.

### Design Goals

#### **Control Plane + Data Plane Separation**

The heart of Blazar's architectural update is a cleaner separation of “data plane” and “control plane” communications within the core protocol:

- In the original EigenDA architecture, the disperser sends a payload to the DA nodes consisting of both metadata (blob headers) and data (encoded chunks).
- In the Blazar upgrade, the disperser simply sends a batch of blob headers to the DA nodes. Upon validating payment and rate limit information, the DA nodes then request to retrieve the associated data payloads from the disperser.

This separation at the protocol level has a few important benefits for enabling improved performance and expanded features:

**Optimized Data Plane Implementations.** Blazar makes possible optimized and scalable data plane implementations for various component implementations:

- The disperser employs a content distribution network composed of specialized “relays” for serving encoded chunks to DA nodes at high volume and low latency.
- DA Nodes can make use of parallelized requests and other strategies to optimize retrieval performance from the relay CDN. In the future, DA nodes themselves can be optimized to be horizontally scalable for improved performance and robustness.

**DDoS protection for decentralized dispersal.** Blazar is one of a few final stepping stones toward decentralized dispersal on EigenDA. In the original EigenDA architecture, the push model of coupled data and control plane messages from disperser to DA node presents a DDoS risk for permissionless dispersal; by enabling DA nodes to elect to initiate data plane interactions, Blazar removes this expensive attack surface, paving the way for a secure decentralized dispersal pattern.

#### Optimized Confirmation Patterns

Blazar removes EigenDA's batched bridging pattern, although this feature may be reintroduced in an optimized form in future releases. A majority of EigenDA integrations are building toward a near-term state of independence from pessimistic on-chain confirmation.

Eliminating batched bridging enables Blazar to transmit data to DA nodes in a steady manner, eliminating bursty traffic that sometimes presents difficulties for node systems, while eliminating a major source of latency present in the original system.

Because the Blazar integration strategy internalizes blob confirmation into the rollup logic, integrations no longer need to wait for Ethereum L1 confirmation or finalization times before referencing a blob within a rollup inbox contract—thus eliminating another major source of latency.

Together, these changes are expected reduce the end-to-end latency of EigenDA from several minutes to several seconds.

#### Other Optimizations

Blazar includes a refined model for data allocation to DA nodes and blob security verification. This model results primarily in simplified logic and reduced encoding burden for the EigenDA disperser.

## Features & Specification

### High-Level Design

Blazar involves updates to the following system components as well as their respective clients:

- Dispersers
- Validator Nodes

![image.png](../../../../static/img/releases/v2-1.png)

In Blazar, the disperser runs a new component known as a Relay, which acts as a server for encoded blob chunks, KZG opening proofs, and unencoded blobs.

### Blob lifecycle

- Client disperses a blob via disperser’s `DisperseBlob` gRPC endpoint. If the request is successful, the blob is in `QUEUED` status.
- Disperser stores the blob in local storage, encodes the blob, and stores the encoded chunks in the relay. The blob is in `ENCODED` status.
- Disperser constructs a batch by collecting the blob headers of encoded blobs and makes `StoreChunks` requests to validator nodes by sending the batch consisting of the blob headers. The blob is in `GATHERING_SIGNATURES` status when these requests are made to the validator network.
- Validator node receives the `StoreChunks` request, retrieves the chunks from the relay, validates them, stores them, and signs the batch.
- Disperser receives the signatures from validator nodes, validates & aggregates them, and produces attestation for the batch. The blob is in `COMPLETE` status.
- Client checks the dispersal status via disperser’s `GetBlobStatus` gRPC endpoint.

### Low-Level Specification

For the full documentation of the EigenDA protobuf schema, see the [`.proto` source files](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/tree/master/api/proto).

#### Offchain Data Structures

Below are some of the fundamental data structures used in many of the EigenDA APIs.

```protobuf
// BlobHeader contains the information describing a blob and the way it is to be dispersed.
message BlobHeader {
  // The blob version. Blob versions are pushed onchain by EigenDA governance in an append only fashion and store the
  // maximum number of operators, number of chunks, and coding rate for a blob. On blob verification, these values
  // are checked against supplied or default security thresholds to validate the security assumptions of the
  // blob's availability.
  uint32 version = 1;
  // quorum_numbers is the list of quorum numbers that the blob is part of.
  // Each quorum will store the data, hence adding quorum numbers adds redundancy, making the blob more likely to be retrievable. Each quorum requires separate payment.
  //
  // On-demand dispersal is currently limited to using a subset of the following quorums:
  // - 0: ETH
  // - 1: EIGEN
  // 
  // Reserved-bandwidth dispersal is free to use multiple quorums, however those must be reserved ahead of time. The quorum_numbers specified here must be a subset of the ones allowed by the on-chain reservation. 
  // Check the allowed quorum numbers by looking up reservation struct: https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/1430d56258b4e814b388e497320fd76354bfb478/contracts/src/interfaces/IPaymentVault.sol#L10
  repeated uint32 quorum_numbers = 2;
  // commitment is the KZG commitment to the blob
  common.BlobCommitment commitment = 3;
  // payment_header contains payment information for the blob
  PaymentHeader payment_header = 4;
}

// BlobCertificate contains a full description of a blob and how it is dispersed. Part of the certificate
// is provided by the blob submitter (i.e. the blob header), and part is provided by the disperser (i.e. the relays).
// Validator nodes eventually sign the blob certificate once they are in custody of the required chunks
// (note that the signature is indirect; validators sign the hash of a Batch, which contains the blob certificate).
message BlobCertificate {
  // blob_header contains data about the blob.
  BlobHeader blob_header = 1;
  // signature is an ECDSA signature signed by the blob request signer's account ID over the BlobHeader's blobKey,
  // which is a keccak hash of the serialized BlobHeader, and used to verify against blob dispersal request's account ID
  bytes signature = 2;
  // relay_keys is the list of relay keys that are in custody of the blob.
  // The relays custodying the data are chosen by the Disperser to which the DisperseBlob request was submitted.
  // It needs to contain at least 1 relay number.
  // To retrieve a blob from the relay, one can find that relay's URL in the EigenDARelayRegistry contract:
  // https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/master/contracts/src/core/EigenDARelayRegistry.sol
  repeated uint32 relay_keys = 3;
}

// BatchHeader is the header of a batch of blobs
message BatchHeader {
  // batch_root is the root of the merkle tree of the hashes of blob certificates in the batch
  bytes batch_root = 1;
  // reference_block_number is the block number that the state of the batch is based on for attestation
  uint64 reference_block_number = 2;
}

// Batch is a batch of blob certificates
message Batch {
  // header contains metadata about the batch
  BatchHeader header = 1;
  // blob_certificates is the list of blob certificates in the batch
  repeated BlobCertificate blob_certificates = 2;
}
```

#### DA Node Interfaces

Blobs are broken up into KZG encoded chunks and distributed to DA nodes. The following API can be used to retrieve those chunks.

In the “happy pathway”, it’s generally going to be faster and easier to retrieve the unencoded blob directly from a relay. Where retrieving chunks from a DA node becomes important is from a security perspective. If all relays in possession of a blob go down or are maliciously/selfishly withholding the data, the DA nodes are a very reliable way to fetch the data (as only a fraction of the chunks distributed to DA nodes are needed to reconstruct the original data).

More detailed documentation on this API can be found [here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/master/api/proto/node/node.proto).

```protobuf
service Retrieval {
  // GetChunks retrieves the chunks for a blob custodied at the Node.
  rpc GetChunks(GetChunksRequest) returns (GetChunksReply) {}
  // Retrieve node info metadata
  rpc NodeInfo(NodeInfoRequest) returns (NodeInfoReply) {}
}
```

#### Relay Interfaces

Relays are responsible for storing and serving both unencoded blobs as well as encoded chunks. Encoded chunks can only be retrieved by authenticated DA validator nodes.

More detailed documentation on this API can be found [here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/master/api/proto/relay/relay.proto).

```protobuf
// Relay is a service that provides access to public relay functionality.
service Relay {
  // GetBlob retrieves a blob stored by the relay.
  rpc GetBlob(GetBlobRequest) returns (GetBlobReply) {}
  // GetChunks retrieves chunks from blobs stored by the relay.
  rpc GetChunks(GetChunksRequest) returns (GetChunksReply) {}
}
```

#### Disperser Interfaces

The disperser API can be used to send blobs to the Eigen DA protocol. More detailed documentation on this API can be found [here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/blob/master/api/proto/disperser/v2/disperser_v2.proto).

```protobuf
// Disperser defines the public APIs for dispersing blobs.
service Disperser {
  // DisperseBlob accepts blob to disperse from clients.
  // This executes the dispersal asynchronously, i.e. it returns once the request
  // is accepted. The client could use GetBlobStatus() API to poll the the
  // processing status of the blob.
  rpc DisperseBlob(DisperseBlobRequest) returns (DisperseBlobReply) {}

  // GetBlobStatus is meant to be polled for the blob status.
  rpc GetBlobStatus(BlobStatusRequest) returns (BlobStatusReply) {}

  // GetBlobCommitment is a utility method that calculates commitment for a blob payload.
  rpc GetBlobCommitment(BlobCommitmentRequest) returns (BlobCommitmentReply) {}

  // GetPaymentState is a utility method to get the payment state of a given account.
  rpc GetPaymentState(GetPaymentStateRequest) returns (GetPaymentStateReply) {}
}
```

### Onchain Interfaces

An overview of where data is stored and what interfaces are available on the EigenDA contracts

#### Blob Verification

On-chain verification of a blob can be performed by calling the EigenDACertVerifier contract or by using the internal EigenDACertVerificationUtils library. As noted previously, these view functions typically will not be called pessimistically within rollup integrations but called within the rollup’s own fault proof or validity proof.

```solidity
// A batch header and corresponding signature attestation over that batch
struct SignedBatch {
    BatchHeaderV2 batchHeader;
    Attestation attestation;
}

// A header for a batch of blobs
struct BatchHeaderV2 {
    bytes32 batchRoot; // the merkle root of the blob certificates in the batch
    uint32 referenceBlockNumber; // the block number that the state of the batch is based on for attestation
}

// A proof for verifying that a blob belongs to a batch
struct BlobInclusionInfo {
    BlobCertificate blobCertificate;
    uint32 blobIndex; // the index of the blob in the merkle tree
    bytes inclusionProof; // the merkle proof for the blobs index
}

// A certifcate for a blob attested as availble by the network
struct BlobCertificate {
    BlobHeaderV2 blobHeader;
    bytes signature;
    uint32[] relayKeys;
}

// A header for blob information
struct BlobHeaderV2 {
    uint16 version; // the blob version
    bytes quorumNumbers; // all quroums that the blob is submitted to
    BlobCommitment commitment;
    bytes32 paymentHeaderHash;
}

// A KZG commitment for a blob
struct BlobCommitment {
    BN254.G1Point commitment;
    BN254.G2Point lengthCommitment;
    BN254.G2Point lengthProof;
    uint32 length;
}

// An attestation by operators that contains BLS signature information
struct Attestation {
    BN254.G1Point[] nonSignerPubkeys;
    BN254.G1Point[] quorumApks;
    BN254.G1Point sigma;
    BN254.G2Point apkG2;
    uint32[] quorumNumbers;
}

// A complete set of information used for BLS signature verification that can be retrieved given an attestation
struct NonSignerStakesAndSignature {
    uint32[] nonSignerQuorumBitmapIndices;
    BN254.G1Point[] nonSignerPubkeys;
    BN254.G1Point[] quorumApks;
    BN254.G2Point apkG2;
    BN254.G1Point sigma;
    uint32[] quorumApkIndices;
    uint32[] totalStakeIndices;
    uint32[][] nonSignerStakeIndices;
}

interface IEigenDACertVerifier {

    // returns if the given BatchHeader, BlobInclusionInfo, and NonSignerStakesAndSignature are valid
    function verifyDACertV2(
        BatchHeaderV2 calldata batchHeader,
        BlobInclusionInfo calldata blobInclusionInfo,
        NonSignerStakesAndSignature calldata nonSignerStakesAndSignature
    ) external view;

    // returns if the given SignedBatch and BlobInclusionInfo are valid
    function verifyDACertV2FromSignedBatch(
        SignedBatch calldata signedBatch,
        BlobInclusionInfo calldata blobInclusionInfo
    ) external view;

    // returns a complete NonSignerStakesAndSignature struct needed for BLS
    // signature verification given an Attestation from a SignedBatch
    function getNonSignerStakesAndSignature(
        SignedBatch calldata signedBatch
    ) external view returns (NonSignerStakesAndSignature memory);

}
```

#### Blob Versions and Security Thresholds

Information about blob versions and security thresholds are stored onchain in the EigenDAThresholdRegistry and can be retrieved from either the EigenDAThresholdRegistry or EigenDACertVerifier contracts

```solidity
// parameters that are stored for a blob version
struct VersionedBlobParams {
    uint32 maxNumOperators;
    uint32 numChunks;
    uint8 codingRate;
}

// a set of securty thresholds that must be met with a blob version
struct SecurityThresholds {
    uint8 confirmationThreshold;
    uint8 adversaryThreshold;
}

interface IEigenDAThresholdRegistry {
    // returns the parameters for a given blob version
    function getBlobParams(uint16 version)
        external view returns (VersionedBlobParams memory);
}

interface IEigenDACertVerifier is IEigenDAThresholdRegistry {
    // verifies a set of given security thresholds against given blob version parameters
    function verifyDACertSecurityParams(
        VersionedBlobParams memory blobParams,
        SecurityThresholds memory securityThresholds
    ) external view;

    // verifies a set of given security thresholds against the parameters of a given blob version
    function verifyDACertSecurityParams(
        uint16 version,
        SecurityThresholds memory securityThresholds
    ) external view;
}
```

#### Disperser

Disperser information is stored onchain and can be retrieved from the EigenDADisperserRegistry contract

```solidity
// The disperser information stored onchain for a disperser key
struct DisperserInfo {
    address disperserAddress;
}

interface IEigenDADisperserRegistry {
    // returns the address for a given disperser key
    function disperserKeyToAddress(uint32 key) external view returns (address);
}
```

#### Relay

ReIay information is stored onchain and can be retrieved from the EigenDARelayRegistry contract

```solidity
// The relay information stored onchain for a relay key
struct RelayInfo {
    address relayAddress;
    string relayURL;
}

interface IEigenDARelayRegistry {

    // returns the address for a given relay key
    function relayKeyToAddress(uint32 key) external view returns (address);

    // returns the URL for a given relay key
    function relayKeyToUrl(uint32 key) external view returns (string memory);

}
```

## Security Considerations

### Throttles

Blazar upgrade introduces enhanced throttling mechanisms to better manage finite resources like bandwidth, memory, and computational capacity. These updates improve system resilience against traffic surges, whether from malicious activity or organic demand spikes. Throttles are calibrated to avoid impacting typical usage while ensuring critical subsystems remain stable under stress.

### Authenticated Traffic

Authenticated traffic now benefits from resource-aware throttling, which allocates resources more effectively by leveraging cryptographic identity verification. Key protocol components, including the disperser, relays, and DA nodes, now utilize authenticated channels to enhance robustness during high-load scenarios. Blazar’s updates significantly strengthen these interactions, bolstering the data backbone’s reliability.

### Enhanced Security for RPCs

Blazar addresses potential denial-of-service risks by introducing authentication for RPCs exposed by DA nodes. This ensures that only callers with valid cryptographic keys can access these RPCs, reducing reliance on external firewalls for security. These changes enhance the platform's security posture and protect against misconfigurations, ensuring more reliable operations.

## Impact Summary

### Validator Operator Impact

Operator will need to update their DA validator node software in order to attest blobs dispersed as part of the Blazar system. Blazar validator node software is implemented in the same binary as V1, so that operators only need to update their node software version.

Blazar bandwidth usage will stay within the parameters of advertised V1 usage, so that existing system requirements specifications remain valid.

### Rollup Stack Impact

Rollups will need to perform the following upgrade actions:

1. **Update data routing**. Deploying a version of https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda-proxy that supports Blazar (internally this new release will use the [EigenDA clients](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/tree/master/api/clients/v2)) will enable use of the Blazar endpoints. We will make an announcement once such a release is ready.
   1. Once you do so, all blob POST request submitted to proxy will be dispersed to the Blazar disperser, and encoded using a commitment with a [0x1 version byte](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda-proxy?tab=readme-ov-file#commitment-schemas) (as opposed to 0x0 for V1).
   2. GET requests will be [routed](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda-proxy/blob/44191c1a1b3149d52a80f2fa82690f4a92ac62db/server/routing.go#L22) to the correct network based on their commitment version byte.
2. **Implement Secure Verification**. We are in the process of individually updating each rollup stack in order to support secure integration strategies (such as fault proofs or validity proofs) for Blazar.

## Action Plan

Blazar will be progressively released to the Holesky testnet and Ethereum mainnet environments according to the following expected timeline. Once Blazar validator software has been released on an environment, validator operators will have a period of some number of weeks in order to upgrade their software. During this period, ejections based on Blazar (V2) signing rates will be paused (ejections based on V1 signing rate will continue to be performed). After this period, operator signing rates will be measured as the worse of V1 and Blazar (V2) signing rate, and will be ejected based on the worse of the two signing rates. Please refer to the "Eligibility for ejection" dates below to ensure the validators are upgraded and avoid ejections.
