If you are able to satisfy all of the [eligibility requirements](../requirements/requirements-overview.md) for becoming a node operator, then you're ready to set up and run your node. 

:::info
Before registering as an operator for EigenDA, operators should [register as an operator with EigenLayer](https://docs.eigencloud.xyz/products/eigenlayer/operators/howto/operator-installation). This process will allow the operator to securely create BLS and ECDSA keys that will be needed during the DA node configuration steps outlined below.
:::

Running an operator node consists of a few main steps:
1. Setting up the system environment and configuring the node (covered in [run with docker](run-with-docker.mdx))
2. Starting the node software and confirming basic operation (covered in [run with docker](run-with-docker.mdx)
3. [Registering the node](./registration/) with one or more quorums. 

Currently, we provide full documentation for performing the first two steps in the context of [running a node using docker](run-with-docker.mdx). 
Operators utilizing other setups can still utilize these instructions as a guide.
