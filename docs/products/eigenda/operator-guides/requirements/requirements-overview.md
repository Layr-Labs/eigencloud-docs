title: Requirements Overview
---

Before deciding to operate an EigenDA node, be sure to fully understand the following aspects of node operation eligibility: 
- [Delegation Requirements](delegation-requirements.mdx): EigenDA currently only allows a limited number of operators to join the protocol. This means that in order to run a node, you must satisfy a minimum stake requirement which adjust over time as new operators and new stake join the protocol.
- [System Requirements](system-requirements.md): Because EigenDA is a horizonally scaling architecture, operator node system requirements scale in accordance with the amount of stake delegated to the operator. Node operators must understand their requirements based on their amount of delegated stake, and be prepared to [upgrade their setups](../upgrades/system-upgrades/) as needed in response to changing stake distributions.
- [Protocol SLA](protocol-SLA.md): All operators are expected to satisfy a service level agreement, with violations having certain protocol level consequences.
