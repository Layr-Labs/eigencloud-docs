# Overview

This guide contains the steps needed to set up your node on the EigenDA testnet.
The testnet is used to test the operational and performance requirements for
running a node before deploying on mainnet. The testnet is under constant stress
tests and has frequent updates to the node software and other network
components. Itâ€™s important to check regularly for new updates to the software
and documentation.

## Migration to EigenDA Blazar (V2)
EigenDA Blazar (V2) is the latest version of the EigenDA protocol.

Current testnet operators running v1 must follow the [Blazar migration guide](./blazar-migration.md) to update their nodes to v2.

## New operator onboarding
Start by understanding the [Requirements](requirements/requirements-overview.md) for being an EigenDA operator and running an EigenDA node. If you are able to satisfy all of the elligibility requirements for becoming a node operator, proceed onward to [run your node](run-a-node/run-overview.md). It's important that you properly [configure and start your node](./run-a-node/run-with-docker/) before [registering your operator with the network](./run-a-node/registration/) and becoming subject to the SLA. 

EigenDA is in a state of active development. Operators must make sure to listen for [node software updates](./upgrades/software-upgrades/) in the correct channels and to implement these upgrades promptly.

## Testing Environments
We have two environments for operators for testing: Holesky testnet and Mainnet Beta. 

[Holesky Testnet](../networks/holesky.md): reserved for functional testing and test traffic will be kept minimal. 

[Mainnet Beta](../networks/mainnet-beta.md): reserved for both functional _and_ load testing. Operators are expected to provision high network bandwidth and large performant storage. Due to potential cost associated with provisioning for large traffic, participation _may_ be incentivized.
