**EigenLayer: The Restaking Collective** ([PDF](/pdf/EigenLayer_WhitePaper.pdf) / <a href="/html/EigenLayer_WhitePaper-converted-xodo.html" target="_blank">HTML</a>): the research paper that formed the basis of the EigenLayer protocol development. The document discusses the original architecture of EigenLayer, the Restaking primitive, and the concept of AVSs. Please note that some components of the design have changed since the original conception of the protocol. Use this document for high level guidance. For specific implementation details, please see the respective protocol implementation source code repositories.


**EIGEN The Universal Intersubjective Work Token:**([PDF](/pdf/EIGEN_Token_Whitepaper.pdf) / <a href="/html/EIGEN_Token_Whitepaper-converted-xodo.html" target="_blank">HTML</a>): the research paper that introduces the structure of the EIGEN token, a universal intersubjective work token. We view this intersubjective work token as a first step towards the goal of building the Verifiable Digital Commons.


**EigenCloud: Build Powerful Crypto Apps on Any Chain with the Verifiable Cloud :**([PDF](/pdf/EigenCloud_Whitepaper.pdf)): the paper that proposes a new architecture that merges the programmability of traditional cloud infrastructure with the verifiability of blockchain systems, enabling developers to build rich, powerful, off-chain applications that interact securely with any chain.
