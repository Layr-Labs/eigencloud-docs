title: Precision and Rounding Considerations
---

:::warning
Slashing in very small increments, slashing operators with very low magnitudes, or slashing operators with very low share balances may lead to precision loss that results in burned/redistributed amounts being far lower than expected.
:::

AVSs should be aware of potential precision loss during slashing operations. This occurs primarily when:
- Operators have very low allocated magnitudes
- Operators have very few delegated shares
- Very small slashing percentages are used
- Tokens with low decimal precision are involved

### Precision Loss Scenarios

**Magnitude-Related Precision Loss:**
When slashing small magnitudes, the `mulWadRoundUp` operations can result in zero redistributed amounts due to rounding. For example:
- Max magnitude: `1e18`
- Allocated magnitude: `1e4`
- wadsToSlash: `1e14`
- Result: Magnitude slashed rounds to 1 [dust](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/dust-transaction), shares slashed rounds to 0

**Share-Related Precision Loss:**
The `calcSlashedAmount` function depends on sufficient precision in operations to avoid zero results when share counts are very low.

**Token Decimal Considerations:**
Low-decimal tokens require higher minimum deposits to maintain precision:
- USDC/USDT (6 decimals): Requires minimum 1000 tokens to reach 1e9 precision
- WBTC (8 decimals): Requires minimum 10 tokens to reach 1e9 precision
- Standard 18-decimal tokens: Generally safe when following magnitude/share thresholds

## Operator Selection and Slashing Guidelines

To minimize precision loss issues, AVSs should implement the following guidelines:

### Operator Registration Criteria

**Magnitude Thresholds:**
- **Reject operators with allocated magnitude under 1e9**: Operators with very low allocated magnitude are more susceptible to precision loss during slashing
- **Checking**: Query `getAllocatedMagnitude()` for each operator-strategy pair before allowing registration

**Share Thresholds:**
- **Reject operators with fewer than 1e9 delegated shares**: Low share counts increase the likelihood of rounding errors that reduce redistributed amounts
- **Checking**: Query operator's total delegated shares across all strategies before registration
- **Cross-validation**: Ensure both magnitude and share thresholds are met simultaneously, as they are interdependent

### Slashing Amount Considerations

**Percentage Thresholds:**
- **Exercise significant caution when slashing less than 0.01% (1e14 WAD)**: Very small slashing percentages are more prone to precision loss
- **Recommendation**: Consider implementing a minimum slash percentage (e.g., 0.1% or 1e15 WAD) for reliable redistribution

### Implementation Recommendations

**Pre-Registration Validation:**
```solidity
// Example validation checks
require(getAllocatedMagnitude(operator, strategy) >= 1e9, "Insufficient magnitude");
require(getOperatorShares(operator) >= 1e9, "Insufficient shares");
require(tokenDecimals >= 6, "Token decimals too low"); // Adjust based on risk tolerance
```

**Pre-Slash Validation:**
```solidity
// Example pre-slash checks
uint256 expectedSlash = calculateExpectedSlash(operator, strategy, slashPercentage);
require(expectedSlash > 0, "Slash amount would round to zero");
require(slashPercentage >= MINIMUM_SLASH_PERCENTAGE, "Slash percentage too small");
```

**Testing and Validation Tools:**
For practical testing of precision considerations, refer to the [precision analysis demo](https://gist.github.com/wadealexc/1997ae306d1a5a08e5d26db1fac8d533) which provides examples of validations and edge case testing for slashing operations.

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
- **Track precision loss events**: Monitor for slashes that result in zero or unexpectedly small redistributed amounts
- **Alert on edge cases**: Set up alerts for operators approaching magnitude/share thresholds
- **Audit slash outcomes**: Regularly verify that slashed amounts match expected calculations

### Risk Assessment Framework

AVSs should evaluate their specific use case against these parameters:

1. **Expected operator size distribution**: Will most operators easily meet the 1e9 thresholds?
2. **Slashing frequency and amounts**: How often and how much do you expect to slash?
3. **Token ecosystem**: What tokens will operators stake, and do they meet decimal requirements?
4. **Precision tolerance**: Can your protocol tolerate small amounts of precision loss?

### Recovery Procedures

- **Dust accumulation**: Understand that precision loss results in small amounts of "dust" remaining in the protocol
- **Operator remediation**: Develop procedures for operators who fall below thresholds (e.g., requiring additional deposits)
- **Slashing adjustments**: Have procedures to adjust slashing parameters if precision loss becomes problematic
