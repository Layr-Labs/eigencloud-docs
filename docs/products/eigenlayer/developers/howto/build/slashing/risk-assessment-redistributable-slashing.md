title: Risk Assessment for Redistributable Slashing
---

Before implementing redistributable slashing, AVSs should conduct:

* Comprehensive risk assessments covering:
    * **Key Management Risks**: Evaluation of current [key security practices](../../../concepts/slashing/key-management-redistributable-slashing.md)
    * **Operational Risks**: Assessment of internal processes and procedures
    * **Technical Risks**: Analysis of smart contract vulnerabilities and integration points
    * **Economic Risks**: Understanding of changed incentive structures and attack economics

* Threat model analysis covering:
    * **Internal Threats**: Key compromise, insider attacks, governance capture
    * **External Threats**: Economic attacks, MEV extraction, coordinated manipulation
    * **Technical Risks**: Smart contract bugs, integration failures, oracle manipulation
    * **Operational Risks**: Key management failures, process breakdowns, communication failures

* Economic incentive analysis covering:
    * **Slash Incentives**: Understand how redistribution changes slashing motivations
    * **Operator Behavior**: Consider how redistribution affects operator incentives
    * **Staker Risks**: Evaluate the risk-reward profile for stakers
    * **Attack Economics**: Analyze the cost-benefit of potential attacks

## Regulatory and Compliance Considerations

AVSs using redistributable slashing should also consider:
- Potential regulatory implications of controlling redistributed funds
- Compliance requirements for fund management and distribution
- Legal liability for key management failures
- Insurance and risk mitigation strategies
