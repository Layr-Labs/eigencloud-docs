:::note
DevKit and Hourglass are currently in public preview meaning they are in active development.
:::

DevKit is the official developer CLI toolkit for building, testing, and managing AVSs using the task-based execution framework Hourglass. 
DevKit provides a streamlined, modular experience enabling developers to go from scaffolding to execution in minutes, not weeks.

Hourglass is a task-based execution framework for building decentralized services (AVSs) requiring verifiable offchain compute. 
Hourglass standardizes how developers define, distribute, execute, and verify compute tasks across decentralized operator networks.

Together, Hourglass and DevKit form the foundation for building scalable, verifiable offchain services on EigenLayer and EigenCloud.

## Get Started with AVS Development

Use DevKit and Hourglass to:

1. Scaffold your AVS project using the DevKit CLI.

   The DevKit CLI initializes an AVS project structure and configuration. Hourglass is the first supported AVS framework for DevKit CLI.

2. Understand and implement using the Hourglass framework.

   The Hourglass framework provides a task-based AVS implementation that provides a standardized approach to defining, distibuting, executing, and verifying compute tasks.

3. Run your AVS on a local devnet.

   The DevKit CLI provides simulation tooling to launch a local devnet and run end-to-end workflows.

## Step-by-Step Guide

For a step-by-step guide on getting started with DevKit, refer to the [DevKit repo](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/devkit-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started).

While in public preview, DevKit is intended for local experimentation and development, and has not yet been audited.
