## What is EigenCompute?
EigenCompute is a verifiable compute service enabling you to run offchain workloads in containerized environments with onchain
verifiability. EigenCompute brings the power of decentralized trust to execution environments traditionally outside the blockchain.

## Why Use EigenCompute?
Smart contracts alone arenâ€™t enough for modern apps. Use EigenCompute when your application:
* Requires AI inference, game simulation, or external data transformations.
* Needs to offload heavy computation without sacrificing trust.
* Wants verifiable, onchain-readable results from decentralized operators.

## How It Works
1. Developers submit compute tasks using a simple API.
2. The task is routed to a decentralized operator network.
3. Operators execute the task and return signed results.
4. Results are verifiable onchain, backed by slashing conditions.

No AVS setup. No validator coordination. No slashing logic to write.

## Use Cases
* DeFi: Verifiable pricing, liquidation logic.
* Gaming: Physics engines, provable randomness.
* AI: Inference and decision workflows.
* RWAs: Proof of document review or asset validation.
