## Why Build an AVS?

Launching new Web3 projects requires substantial time and effort to bootstrap capital and operators. Builders should focus on their core product differentiators rather than bootstrapping economic security. Building an Autonomous Verifiable Service (AVS) on EigenLayer offers enhanced security, decentralization, and cost efficiency by utilizing Ethereum’s staking mechanism through restaking. This allows developers to focus more on their product’s core value and innovation without the significant overhead of setting up a new consensus mechanism or validator networks from scratch.

The key benefits of building an AVS on EigenLayer include:
- Security via Restaking: leverage Ethereum’s staking mechanism to secure your service.
- Focus on your project's unique value: spend less time and resources accumulating economic security from scratch.
- Bootstrap your Operator network: quickly access a large network of experienced Operators.
- Decentralization and Trust: build on trust-minimized, decentralized infrastructure.
- Composability: seamlessly integrate with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
