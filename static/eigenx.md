This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.
The content has been processed where content has been compressed (code blocks are separated by ⋮---- delimiter).

# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Content has been compressed - code blocks are separated by ⋮---- delimiter
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

# Go Development Guidelines for eigenx-cli

This document outlines coding standards, patterns, and best practices to be followed when developing Go applications and libraries for the `eigenx-cli` project. These rules are based on general Go best practices and observed patterns within this 
codebase.

## 0. Always..

- Run `make tests` when completing a task to make sure the entire test suite passes
- Run `make lint` to lint the code

## 1. Code Formatting

- **`gofmt`/`goimports`**: All Go code **MUST** be formatted using `gofmt` or `goimports` before committing. This ensures consistent code style across the project. `goimports` is preferred as it also manages import statements.
    - Configure your IDE to format on save.
    - This is likely enforced by pre-commit hooks.

## 2. Naming Conventions

- **Packages**:
    - Package names **SHOULD** be short, concise, and all lowercase.
    - Avoid overly generic names like `util` or `common` unless the package truly contains cross-cutting concerns. If so, sub-packages within `common` (e.g., `common/httputil`) are preferred.
    - The project uses `pkg/common` for shared utilities (e.g., `logger`, context management), which is acceptable.
- **Variables**:
    - Local variables and function parameters **SHOULD** use `camelCase` (e.g., `myVariable`).
    - Exported variables **MUST** use `PascalCase` (e.g., `ExportedVariable`).
- **Functions and Methods**:
    - Function and method names **SHOULD** use `camelCase` for unexported identifiers (e.g., `calculateValue`).
    - Exported functions and methods **MUST** use `PascalCase` (e.g., `CalculateValue`).
- **Interfaces**:
    - Interfaces **SHOULD** be named with the `-er` suffix if they have only one method (e.g., `Reader`, `Writer`).
    - For more complex interfaces, choose a name that describes its purpose (e.g., `DataStore`).
- **Avoid Stutter**: Do not repeat package names in identifiers. For example, in package `logger`, prefer `logger.New()` over `logger.NewLogger()`.
- **Acronyms**: Acronyms like HTTP, ID, URL **SHOULD** be consistently cased (e.g., `serveHTTP`, `userID`, `parseURL`). `PascalCase` for exported acronyms (e.g., `ServeHTTP`, `UserID`, `ParseURL`).

## 3. Packages and Project Structure

- **`cmd/`**: Main application(s). Each subdirectory in `cmd/` is a separate executable.
- **`pkg/`**: Library code that can be used by other applications or projects. Code here should be designed to be reusable.
    - CLI command logic is well-organized under `pkg/commands`.
- **`internal/`**: Private application and library code. This is the ideal place for code that is specific to this project and should not be imported by other projects.
    - The `internal/version` pattern for build-time variable injection is good.
- **Clarity**: Package structure should clearly communicate the purpose and separation of concerns.
- **Circular Dependencies**: Avoid circular dependencies between packages.

## 4. Error Handling

- **Explicit Handling**: Errors **MUST** be handled explicitly. Do not ignore errors using the blank identifier (`_`) unless there is a very specific and documented reason.
- **Return Errors**: Functions that can fail **MUST** return an `error` as their last return value.
- **Error Wrapping**: When an error is propagated up the call stack, it **SHOULD** be wrapped with additional context using `fmt.Errorf("operation X failed: %w", err)`. This preserves the original error and adds a stack of contextual information.
    - Use `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()` from the standard `errors` package to inspect wrapped errors.
- **Error Messages**: Error messages should be lowercase and not end with punctuation, as they are often combined with other context.
- **Top-Level Handling**: In `main()` or top-level HTTP handlers, errors should be logged appropriately, and the program/request should terminate gracefully (e.g., `log.Fatal(err)` in `main.go` is acceptable for CLI startup).

## 5. Comments and Documentation

- **Godoc**: All exported identifiers (variables, constants, functions, types) **MUST** have Godoc comments.
    - Comments should start with the name of the identifier they describe.
    - Provide clear, concise explanations of what the identifier does, its parameters, and return values.
- **Non-Obvious Code**: Add comments to explain complex, non-obvious, or surprising logic.
- **TODOs**: Use `// TODO:` comments to mark areas that need future attention. Include context or a reference if possible.

## 6. Logging

- **Structured Logging**: Use a structured logging library like `zap` (as currently used in `pkg/common/logger/zap_logger.go`).
- **Log Levels**: Use appropriate log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL).
- **Contextual Information**: Include relevant contextual information in log messages (e.g., request IDs, user IDs) to aid debugging.
- **Avoid Logging and Returning Errors**: Generally, a function should either log an error and handle it, or return the error to the caller to handle. Avoid doing both unless there's a specific reason. The caller is usually better positioned to decide if logging is appropriate.

## 7. Concurrency

- **Goroutines**: Use goroutines for concurrent operations. Ensure they are managed correctly (e.g., using `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for completion).
- **Channels**: Prefer channels for communication between goroutines and for synchronization.
- **`context.Context`**:
    - Pass `context.Context` as the first argument to functions that perform I/O, long-running computations, or need to support cancellation or deadlines.
    - The project correctly uses `context.Context` (e.g., `common.WithShutdown(context.Background())`).
- **Race Conditions**: Be mindful of race conditions. Use the Go race detector (`go test -race`) during testing. Protect shared mutable state using mutexes (`sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`) or channels.

## 8. Testing

- **File Naming**: Test files **MUST** be named `*_test.go`.
- **Function Naming**: Test functions **MUST** be named `TestXxx` (where `Xxx` starts with an uppercase letter) and take `*testing.T` as a parameter.
- **Coverage**: Strive for high test coverage. Use `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out && go tool cover -html=coverage.out` to inspect coverage.
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Use table-driven tests for testing multiple scenarios of the same function with different inputs and expected outputs.
- **Subtests**: Use `t.Run` to create subtests for better organization and output.
- **Assertions**: Use standard library features or well-known assertion libraries if necessary. Avoid overly complex custom assertion logic.
- **Mocks/Fakes**: Use fakes or mocks for dependencies, especially for external services or components that are hard to set up in a test environment.

## 9. API Design

- **Interfaces**: Define interfaces on the consumer side where appropriate. This promotes loose coupling and makes code easier to test and mock.
- **Simplicity**: Strive for simple and clear API designs. Avoid overly complex or numerous parameters.
- **Return Values**: Be consistent with return value patterns (e.g., `(value, error)` or `(value, bool)`).

## 10. Dependency Management

- **Go Modules**: Use Go Modules (`go.mod`, `go.sum`) for dependency management.
- **Tidy Modules**: Keep `go.mod` and `go.sum` tidy by running `go mod tidy` regularly.
- **Dependency Updates**: Regularly review and update dependencies to incorporate security patches and bug fixes.

## 11. Linters and Static Analysis

- **`golangci-lint`**: Use `golangci-lint` or a similar comprehensive linter tool.
    - A `.golangci.yml` configuration file should be present in the repository to define enabled linters and settings.
    - Integrate linters into pre-commit hooks (as suggested by `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).

## 12. CLI Specific (using `urfave/cli/v2`)

- **Command Structure**: Define commands and subcommands clearly, following the patterns in `pkg/commands/devnet.go`.
- **Flags**: Use descriptive names and usage messages for flags. Provide sensible default values.
- **Actions**: Command actions should encapsulate the logic for that command. Delegate complex logic to other packages/functions.
- **Context Usage**: Utilize the `cli.Context` for accessing flags, arguments, and application-level values.
- **Hooks**: Leverage hooks (e.g., `Before`, `After`) for common setup/teardown tasks, as seen with `hooks.LoadEnvFile` and `hooks.WithCommandMetricsContext`.

## 13. General Best Practices

- **Keep it Simple (KISS)**: Prefer simple, readable code over overly clever or complex solutions.
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Avoid code duplication by abstracting common logic into functions or methods.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Functions and types should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Avoid `init()`**: Use `init()` functions sparingly. Explicit initialization in `main()` or via factory functions is often clearer.
- **Avoid Global Variables**: Minimize the use of global variables. If used, ensure they are concurrency-safe. The version variables in `internal/version` are a common exception, typically set at build time.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure resources like file handles, network connections, etc., are properly closed (e.g., using `defer`).

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, you'll need:

- **Docker** - To package and publish your application image
  - [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
  - You'll also need to `docker login` to push images to your registry
- **ETH** - To pay for deployment transactions
  - For Sepolia testnet: [Google Cloud Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) or [Alchemy Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)

## Deployment

```bash
# Store your private key (generate new or use existing)
eigenx auth generate --store
# OR: eigenx auth login (if you have an existing key)

eigenx app deploy username/image-name
```

The CLI will automatically detect the `Dockerfile` and build your app before deploying.

## Management & Monitoring

### App Lifecycle
```bash
eigenx app list                    # List all apps
eigenx app info [app-name]         # Get app details
eigenx app logs [app-name]         # View logs
eigenx app start [app-name]        # Start stopped app
eigenx app stop [app-name]         # Stop running app
eigenx app terminate [app-name]    # Terminate app
eigenx app upgrade [app-name] [image] # Update deployment
eigenx app configure tls            # Configure TLS
```

### App Naming
```bash
eigenx app name [app-id] [new-name]  # Update friendly name
```

## TLS Configuration (Optional)

This project includes **optional** automatic TLS certificate management using Caddy. The Caddyfile is not required - if you don't need TLS termination or prefer to handle it differently, you can simply delete the Caddyfile.

### How It Works

When a `Caddyfile` is present in your project root:
- Caddy will automatically start as a reverse proxy
- It handles TLS certificate acquisition and renewal via Let's Encrypt
- Your app runs on `APP_PORT` and Caddy forwards HTTPS traffic to it
- Certificates are stored persistently in the TEE's encrypted storage

Without a `Caddyfile`:
- Your application runs directly on the configured ports
- You can handle TLS in your application code or use an external load balancer

### Deployment Checklist

Before deploying with TLS:
1. **Configure TLS**: Run `eigenx app configure tls` to add the necessary configuration files for domain setup with private traffic termination in the TEE.
2. **DNS**: Ensure A/AAAA record points to your instance (or reserved static IP). Note: If this is your first deployment, you will need to get your IP after deployment from the `eigenx app info` command.
3. **Required configuration** in `.env`:
   ```bash
   DOMAIN=mydomain.com          # Your domain name
   APP_PORT=8000               # Your app's port
   ACME_STAGING=true           # Test with staging first to avoid rate limits
   ENABLE_CADDY_LOGS=true      # Enable logs for debugging
   ```

4. **Optional ACME configuration** (all optional, with sensible defaults):
   ```bash
   # ACME email for Let's Encrypt notifications
   ACME_EMAIL=admin@example.com

   # Certificate Authority directory URL
   # Default: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
   ACME_CA=https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

   # ACME Challenge Type
   # How to prove domain ownership to Let's Encrypt
   # Both result in the same TLS certificate, just different validation methods:
   # - http-01: Uses port 80 (default)
   # - tls-alpn-01: Uses port 443
   ACME_CHALLENGE=http-01

   # Use Let's Encrypt Staging (for testing)
   # Set to true to use staging environment (certificates won't be trusted by browsers)
   # Great for testing without hitting rate limits
   ACME_STAGING=true

   # Force certificate reissue
   # Set to true to force a new certificate even if one exists
   # This will delete the existing certificate from storage and get a new one
   ACME_FORCE_ISSUE=true
   ```

5. **Customize Caddyfile** (optional):
   - Edit `Caddyfile` to match your application port
   - Modify security headers as needed
   - Configure rate limiting or other middleware

### TLS Testing & Debugging

- **Enable Caddy logs** to see TLS-related output:
  ```bash
  ENABLE_CADDY_LOGS=true
  ```

- **Use Let's Encrypt staging** for testing (avoids rate limits, but certificates won't be trusted by browsers):
  ```bash
  ACME_STAGING=true
  ```

### Local Development

For local development without TLS, leave `DOMAIN` empty or set to `localhost` in your `.env` file.

### Custom Certificates

To use custom certificates instead of Let's Encrypt, modify the `Caddyfile`:
```caddyfile
tls /path/to/cert.pem /path/to/key.pem
```

# EigenX Architecture Guide

## Summary

EigenX enables developers to deploy **verifiable applications** in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Each app receives its own deterministic wallet that serves as its cryptographic identity, allowing it to sign transactions, hold funds, and operate autonomously.

---

## Core Concept: Deterministic Application Identities

### How EigenX Enables Autonomous Applications

When you deploy an app through EigenX, the system provides:

1. **A unique private key** derived deterministically from your app's ID
2. **Hardware-isolated execution** via Intel TDX trusted execution environments
3. **Cryptographic attestation** proving which exact Docker image (by digest) has access to the key
4. **Autonomous capabilities** - your app can hold funds, sign transactions, and operate independently

This architecture enables applications to act as self-sovereign entities with their own wallets, where users can verify the exact code running rather than trusting the developer.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Code] -->|Deploy to TEE| B[Hardware-Isolated App]
    B -->|Gets Identity| C[Deterministic Private Key]
    C -->|Enables| D[Autonomous Operations]
```

---

## System Architecture Layers

The system is organized into four distinct layers, each with clear responsibilities:

### 1. Trust Layer
**Purpose**: Establish what should run and who gets keys

| Component | What It Is | Role in System | Technology |
|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **Blockchain** | Ethereum smart contracts | Source of truth for app configurations and authorized code | Solidity on Ethereum |
| **KMS** | Key Management Service | Gatekeeper that verifies TEE attestations and provides deterministic keys and app secrets | Rust service with HSM |

### 2. Execution Layer  
**Purpose**: Run your code in hardware isolation

| Component | What It Is | Role in System | Technology |
|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **TEE Instance** | Hardware-isolated VM | Secure runtime for your Docker container | Intel TDX on Google Cloud |

### 3. Automation Layer
**Purpose**: Bridge blockchain events to infrastructure (no access to secrets)

| Component | What It Is | Role in System | Technology |
|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **Coordinator** | Event processor service | Watches blockchain, provisions/manages VMs | Rust with PostgreSQL |

### 4. Developer Layer
**Purpose**: Tools for building and deploying

| Component | What It Is | Role in System | Technology |
|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **CLI** | Command-line tool | Build, deploy, and manage apps | Go |
| **Registry** | Docker registry | Store and distribute container images | Any OCI registry |

## How The System Works

### Deployment Flow: Phase by Phase

#### Phase 1: Developer Deployment

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant CLI as CLI
    participant Reg as Registry
    participant Chain as Blockchain

    Dev->>CLI: eigenx app deploy
    CLI->>CLI: Build Docker image
    CLI->>Reg: Push image
    CLI->>CLI: Encrypt secrets with KMS public key
    CLI->>Chain: Submit transaction<br/>(image digest + encrypted secrets)
    Chain->>Chain: Store release data
    Chain-->>Chain: Emit AppCreated + AppUpgraded + AppStarted events
```

**What happens:**
1. Developer runs `eigenx app deploy` with their application
2. CLI builds a Docker image and pushes to registry
3. CLI encrypts developer's secrets using KMS's public key (RSA-OAEP + AES-256-GCM)
4. CLI submits transaction with image digest, encrypted secrets, and public environment variables
5. Smart contract stores this data and emits events

#### Phase 2: Infrastructure Provisioning

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Chain as Blockchain
    participant Coord as Coordinator
    participant GCP as Google Cloud
    participant TEE as TEE Instance

    Chain-->>Coord: AppCreated + AppUpgraded + AppStarted events
    Coord->>Coord: Process event
    Coord->>GCP: Create Confidential VM
    GCP->>TEE: Boot with Intel TDX
    TEE->>TEE: Generate attestation
```

**What happens:**
1. Coordinator service detects blockchain events
2. Coordinator provisions a new Google Confidential Space VM
3. VM boots with Intel TDX hardware isolation
4. TEE generates launch attestation JWT proving its configuration

#### Phase 3: Secret Retrieval & App Startup

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant TEE as TEE Instance
    participant KMS as KMS
    participant Chain as Blockchain
    participant App as Your App

    TEE->>KMS: Request secrets<br/>(with attestation JWT)
    KMS->>Chain: Verify image digest
    KMS->>KMS: Validate attestation
    KMS->>KMS: Generate mnemonic<br/>HMAC(appID)
    KMS->>TEE: Return encrypted<br/>(mnemonic + secrets)
    TEE->>App: Start with env vars
    App->>App: Use mnemonic for wallet
```

**What happens:**
1. TEE sends attestation to KMS requesting secrets
2. KMS verifies the TEE is genuine and running correct code
3. KMS generates deterministic mnemonic for this app
4. KMS returns encrypted mnemonic + developer secrets
5. App starts with `MNEMONIC` environment variable

### Complete Deployment Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Developer
    participant CLI
    participant Blockchain
    participant Infrastructure
    participant TEE
    participant KMS
    participant App
    
    Developer->>Developer: Write Code
    Developer->>CLI: eigenx app deploy
    CLI->>CLI: Build Docker Image
    CLI->>CLI: Push to Registry
    CLI->>CLI: Encrypt Secrets
    CLI->>Blockchain: Submit to Blockchain
    Blockchain->>Blockchain: Store Image Digest
    Blockchain->>Infrastructure: Emit Events
    Infrastructure->>Infrastructure: Coordinator Detects
    Infrastructure->>TEE: Provision TEE VM
    TEE->>TEE: Generate Attestation
    TEE->>KMS: Request Keys from KMS
    KMS->>KMS: Verify TEE Hardware
    KMS->>KMS: Check Image on Chain
    KMS->>KMS: Generate Deterministic Key
    KMS->>TEE: Return Key + Secrets
    TEE->>App: App Starts with Identity
    App->>App: Can Sign & Transact
```

### App Lifecycle State Machine

Your app moves through these states during its lifetime:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created: eigenx app create
    Created --> Deploying: eigenx app deploy
    Deploying --> Running: TEE boots successfully
    Running --> Upgrading: eigenx app upgrade (new version)
    Upgrading --> Running: Update complete
    Running --> Stopping: eigenx app stop
    Stopping --> Stopped: VM terminated
    Stopped --> Deploying: eigenx app start
    Running --> Terminated: eigenx app terminate
    Stopped --> Terminated: eigenx app terminate
    Terminated --> [*]
```

## System Guarantees

### What This Architecture Guarantees ✅

| Guarantee | How It's Achieved | What It Means |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Code Integrity** | Only exact Docker images (by digest) stored onchain can run | Users know precisely what code is executing |
| **Key Exclusivity** | TEE attestation required for key access | Only TEE instances running verified code receive keys |
| **Deterministic Identity** | HMAC(appID) generates same key every time | App keeps same addresses even after redeployment |
| **Hardware Isolation** | Intel TDX memory encryption | Keys are isolated from host operating system |
| **Attestation Chain** | Hardware → Google → KMS → Blockchain | Cryptographic proof of what's running |

### Current Trust Requirements ⚠️

| Component | What You Trust | Why It's Needed | Future Solution |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **KMS Operator** | Single entity controls key release | Centralized attestation verification | Threshold KMS (M-of-N) |
| **RPC Provider** | Accuracy of blockchain data | KMS needs to verify image digests | Light client in TEE |
| **No Replica Protection** | Apps can run multiple instances | No hardware-enforced singleton | Consensus mechanism |

---

## Why This Architecture Matters

### Autonomous Application Capabilities

With deterministic identities, applications can:
- **Manage their own wallets** - receive and control funds directly
- **Sign transactions independently** - no external key management infrastructure  
- **Provide cryptographic proofs** - users verify code, not developer promises
- **Operate trustlessly** - behavior determined by published code

### Example Use Cases

| Use Case | How EigenX Enables It |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Trading Bot** | Holds user funds in its own wallet, executes trades based on strategy, can't steal money (code is verified) |
| **Data Oracle** | Signs data feeds with its identity, proves it's running unmodified aggregation code |
| **Game Server** | Manages in-game assets fairly, players can verify game logic isn't cheating |
| **Escrow Service** | Holds funds autonomously, releases based on code logic, no trusted third party |
| **DAO Executor** | Executes DAO decisions autonomously, members verify execution logic |

---

## Developer Integration

### Architecture Comparison

**Traditional Architecture:**
```
Application Server → Private Keys (Developer Controlled) → Signing Operations → Users Trust Developer
```

**EigenX Architecture:**
```
TEE Instance → Deterministic Key (via KMS) → Signing Operations → Users Verify Code
```

The key distinction: applications receive keys deterministically based on their identity, with the TEE hardware guaranteeing that only the exact Docker image stored onchain can access those keys. This removes the need for developers to manage private keys and enables users to cryptographically verify what code has access to funds.

### Development Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create App] --> B[Write Code]
    B --> C[Test Locally]
    C --> D[Deploy to TEE]
    D --> E[App Runs Autonomously]
```

1. **Create**: `eigenx app create my-app typescript`
2. **Develop**: Write your application logic
3. **Test**: Run locally with test mnemonics
4. **Deploy**: `eigenx app deploy` (automatic encryption)
5. **Verify**: Check app addresses with `eigenx app info`

### Integration Example

```typescript
// The application receives its identity via environment variable
const mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC  // Provided by KMS after attestation

// Derive wallets for any supported chain
import { mnemonicToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
const ethAccount = mnemonicToAccount(mnemonic)

// Application capabilities:
// 1. Receive funds at deterministic address
const address = ethAccount.address

// 2. Create cryptographic proofs of identity
const signature = await ethAccount.signMessage({
  message: 'Attestation from verified trading bot'
})

// 3. Execute transactions autonomously
const tx = await walletClient.sendTransaction({
  account: ethAccount,
  to: userAddress,
  value: profitShare
})
```

### Key Properties for Developers

1. **Deterministic Derivation**: Consistent key generation via HMAC(appID)
2. **Environment Injection**: Keys provided via `MNEMONIC` environment variable
3. **Chain Agnostic**: Support for BIP-44 derivation across multiple blockchains
4. **No Key Management**: Infrastructure handles key distribution post-attestation

---

## Verification Flow

Developers can cryptographically verify application authenticity:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User] -->|1\. Check onchain| B[Image Digest]
    A -->|2\. Query| C[User API /info endpoint]
    C -->|3\. Returns| D[Expected Addresses<br/>+ ECDSA Signature]
    A -->|4\. Query| E[Your App]
    E -->|5\. Returns| F[Signed Message]
    A -->|6\. Verify| G{Signature Matches<br/>Expected Address?}
    G -->|Yes| H[✅ Verified]
    G -->|No| I[❌ Impostor]
```

The KMS provides a signed message that includes what addresses your app should have, and users can verify your app controls those addresses.

---

## Roadmap

### Current State
- ✅ Basic TEE deployment with deterministic keys
- ✅ Google Confidential Spaces integration
- ✅ Single KMS operator model

### Coming Soon
- ⏳ Intel Trust Authority attestations (publicly verifiable, bypass Google CS attestations)
- ⏳ Public runtime attestations from apps
- ⏳ Threshold KMS (M-of-N distributed key management)
- ⏳ Replica prevention via onchain checks and heartbeats
- ⏳ Light client or full node in TEE (remove RPC dependency)
- ⏳ Verifiably built images
- ⏳ Persistent storage

---

## Recap

EigenX provides a foundational primitive for blockchain applications: **deterministic, hardware-attested application identities**. This enables autonomous applications that can manage funds, sign transactions, and operate independently while remaining cryptographically verifiable.

The architecture combines blockchain for configuration truth, TEEs for isolated execution, and deterministic key derivation to create a new class of verifiable applications. While the current implementation requires trust in the KMS operator, the progressive decentralization roadmap addresses this through threshold cryptography and enhanced verification mechanisms.

This approach enables previously impossible use cases: trustless trading bots, verifiable oracles, autonomous escrow services, and other applications where users need cryptographic guarantees about code behavior rather than trusting developers.

# EigenX Concepts Guide

A comprehensive guide to understanding keys, environment variables, app lifecycle, and privacy in EigenX CLI.

---

# Overview of Keys

EigenX CLI uses two distinct key types. Each has a specific role, lifecycle, and security boundary.

## 1. EigenX Auth Keys (`eigenx auth`)

| Category      | Details                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**   | Developer authentication for deployments and protocol interactions                                                          |
| **Type**      | secp256k1 private key (Ethereum-compatible)                                                                                 |
| **Location**  | Local OS or organization keyring (macOS Keychain, 1Password, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service, etc.)       |
| **Lifecycle** | - Generate: `eigenx auth generate` <br> - Import: `eigenx auth login` <br> - View: `eigenx auth whoami`, `eigenx auth list` |
| **Security**  | Developer must secure and store this secret securely to sign deployment transactions                                        |

## 2. TEE Mnemonic

| Category        | Details                                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Persistent wallet for applications running inside a TEE                       |
| **Type**        | BIP-39 mnemonic phrase (12/24 words)                                          |
| **Origin**      | Generated by [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md), released only to your application via enclave [attestation](https://docs.trustauthority.intel.com/main/articles/articles/ita/concept-attestation-overview.html)  |
| **Location**    | Encrypted at rest in [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md); only decryptable inside your specific TEE application|
| **Access**      | Provided at runtime via `process.env.MNEMONIC`                                |
| **Persistence** | Stable across restarts and deployments                                        |
| **Security**    | The mnemonic is cryptographically bound to your specific TEE instance. No other TEE, application, or party can decrypt it. Once inside the TEE, it's a plain secret and should be handled with care. Do not log or exfiltrate it. |

## Key Storage Locations

| Location                                | Keys             | Notes                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local Machine (OS Keyring)**          | EigenX Auth Keys | Stored under `eigenx-<environment>` (e.g., `eigenx-mainnet`)        |
| **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)** | TEE Mnemonic     | [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md)-generated, persistent wallet, bound to your app via [attestation](https://docs.trustauthority.intel.com/main/articles/articles/ita/concept-attestation-overview.html) |

## Security Model

* **Auth Keys** Developer owned. Must be backed up and secured.
* **TEE Mnemonic** [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md) managed. Only your specific TEE application can decrypt it, but app developers must handle it like any sensitive secret once inside.

## Key Distinctions

* **Auth Keys** are for developers and used for protocol operations, deployments.
* **TEE Mnemonic** is for applications and used for persistent wallet functionality inside the TEE. It also gives the ability to verify that you are communicating with the correct TEE application.

The TEE mnemonic is generated by the [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md) and bound to your app's enclave, ensuring consistency across deployments. But once injected, its safety depends on the app not leaking it.

# Overview of Environment Variables

EigenX CLI encrypts your sensitive configuration during deployment using [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md) encryption keys. This ensures your secrets remain accessible exclusively to your TEE application, never to third parties, operators, or other applications. You can optionally make certain values public for user transparency.

## Environment Variable Security

| Category        | Details                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encryption**  | During deployment, all `.env` variables are encrypted with a [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md) key unique to your TEE |
| **Storage**     | Encrypted environment variables are posted on-chain                           |
| **Decryption**  | Decryption happens only inside your TEE at runtime - inaccessible to anyone else |
| **Access**      | Available to your application via standard `process.env` variables           |
| **Security**    | Your responsibility to handle securely and not exfiltrate from the TEE       |

## Public Variables

| Category        | Details                                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Suffix**      | Add `_PUBLIC` suffix to variable names for transparency                       |
| **Visibility**  | `_PUBLIC` variables are visible to users and not encrypted                   |
| **Use Case**    | Configuration values that should be transparent (e.g., `API_URL_PUBLIC`)     |
| **Security**    | No sensitive data should use the `_PUBLIC` suffix                            |

## Security Model

* **Encrypted Variables** [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md) managed, on-chain storage, cryptographically bound to your TEE
* **Public Variables** Transparent to users, not encrypted, visible on-chain
* **Application Responsibility** Handle all environment variables securely once inside TEE

## Environment Variable Distinctions

* **Standard `.env` variables** are encrypted and decryptable exclusively within your TEE
* **`_PUBLIC` suffixed variables** are transparent and visible to users for configuration transparency

**Current Security Model (Mainnet Alpha):** EigenLabs has access to [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md) signing and decryption keys, meaning they can theoretically access encrypted environment variables. This access is necessary for current operations but will be migrated to a hardened external system.

**Future Security Model:** A new set of keys will be generated and moved to an external hardened system. This will enable encryption/decryption and key derivation without EigenLabs access. Additionally, KMS upgrades will require onchain authorization.

Decryption is cryptographically restricted to your specific TEE instance and authorized parties. Your application must handle these values responsibly and never log or exfiltrate sensitive data.

# Overview of App Lifecycle

EigenX applications progress through distinct states with specific transitions. Understanding these states helps manage deployments effectively.

## App States

| State          | Details                                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Created**    | App registered in AppController contract but no infrastructure deployed yet          |
| **Running**    | App is actively running and serving traffic                                  |
| **Stopped**    | App temporarily stopped, can be resumed without losing configuration         |
| **Exited**     | App process finished executing and exited normally (exit code 0). Your application enters this state when your code finishes execution. If you want your app to run continuously, ensure you have a long running process like a web server. |
| **Failed**     | App process crashed or terminated with non-zero exit code                   |
| **Terminated** | App permanently destroyed, all resources deallocated                         |

## State Transitions

| Transition     | Details                                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deploying**  | Infrastructure deployment process, moving from Created to Running            |
| **Upgrading**  | Updating existing app with new image, maintains configuration and data       |
| **Resuming**   | Restarting a Stopped/Exited app, moving to Running                          |
| **Stopping**   | Gracefully stopping a Running app, moving to Stopped state                  |
| **Terminating**| Permanently destroying app and resources, moving to Terminated state        |

## Lifecycle Flow

### Initial Deployment
App is registered in AppController contract (Created state), then infrastructure deployment begins (Deploying), and finally reaches Running state when application code is running.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> Created : Contract registration
    Created --> Deploying : Infrastructure deployment begins
    Deploying --> Running : Application running
```

### From Running State
Once running, apps can be stopped, can exit normally, fail, be terminated, or upgraded.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    Running --> Stopped : Stop
    Running --> Exited : Process Exit (0)
    Running --> Failed : Process Crash/Error
    Running --> Terminated : Terminate
    Running --> Running : Upgrade
```

### Resuming Apps
Stopped, Exited, and Failed apps can all be restarted back to Running state.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    Stopped --> Running : Resume/Start
    Exited --> Running : Restart
    Failed --> Running : Restart
```

### Terminal State
Only Terminated apps reach a true final state with all resources destroyed.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    Terminated --> [*]
```

## Lifecycle Distinctions

* **Created vs Running** Created means app is registered but no infrastructure exists; Running means infrastructure is deployed and serving
* **Deploy vs Start** Deploy only registers the app in smart contract; Start actually provisions infrastructure
* **Stopped vs Terminated** Stopped apps can be resumed with all configuration intact; Terminated apps are permanently destroyed
* **Exited vs Failed** Both indicate the app process ended, but Failed indicates an error occurred.
* **Continuous vs Batch** Web servers and long running services stay in Running state; batch jobs and scripts naturally transition to Exited when complete

# Overview of Privacy

EigenX CLI provides strong privacy guarantees through TEE isolation and encryption. Understanding what's private and what's visible helps developers build secure applications.

## Private to your TEE application

| Category              | Details                                                                       | Example Use Case |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **TEE Mnemonic**      | [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md)-generated mnemonic only accessible inside your specific TEE instance     | Build an autonomous trading bot that manages real funds without exposing private keys to operators |
| **Encrypted Env Vars**| Environment variables encrypted by [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md), only decryptable within your TEE     | Store API keys for payment processors or AI services that your app uses - even EigenLabs can't see them |
| **Application Code**  | Your containerized application runs in isolation within the TEE              | Run proprietary trading algorithms or ML models where the logic itself is valuable IP |
| **Runtime Data**      | Memory contents, temporary files, and process state isolated in TEE          | Process user PII or financial data in memory without it being accessible to cloud providers |
| **Private Keys**      | Any keys derived from or stored within the TEE environment                   | Generate signing keys for multi-party computation or [attestations](https://docs.trustauthority.intel.com/main/articles/articles/ita/concept-attestation-overview.html) that prove computation happened correctly |

## Publicly Visible Information

| Category              | Details                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **App Metadata**      | App ID, name, deployment status, and basic configuration                     |
| **Container Image**   | Docker image reference and tags used for deployment                          |
| **Container Registry**| Your container hosted on DockerHub/OCI registries is publicly viewable      |
| **Public Env Vars**  | Environment variables with `_PUBLIC` suffix                                  |
| **Network Endpoints** | Public IP addresses and exposed ports for your application                   |
| **Logs (If Public)** | Application logs only if configured to be public (private by default)        |

## Customer Privacy Guarantees

| Guarantee             | Details                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Isolation**    | Your application code executes in hardware-enforced isolation                |
| **Data Encryption**   | All sensitive data encrypted at rest and decryptable within TEE. In the Mainnet Alpha, EigenLabs has KMS key access. Future releases will use a hardened external system with onchain-authorized upgrades.         |
| **Attestation-Based**| [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md) releases secrets to verified TEE instances via cryptographic [attestation](https://docs.trustauthority.intel.com/main/articles/articles/ita/concept-attestation-overview.html) proof  |
| **Limited Admin Access**  | EigenLabs cannot access your TEE's internal state or memory. However, in the Mainnet Alpha they have access to KMS keys for encryption/decryption operations.         |

## Privacy Distinctions

* **Private by default** All application data and environment variables are private unless explicitly marked public
* **TEE boundary** Privacy protection exists at the TEE hardware level, not just software isolation
* **Customer control** You decide what information to make transparent through public environment variables
* **Container transparency** Your container image on DockerHub/OCI registries is publicly accessible, allowing users to audit and understand trust assumptions
* **Log privacy control** Application logs can be configured as private (default) or public based on your transparency requirements

---

# Security Best Practices

## Do's

* **Secure Auth Keys** Store your EigenX auth keys in organization password managers (1Password, etc.) and back them up securely
* **Validate Inputs** Always validate and sanitize inputs in your TEE application - TEE isolation doesn't eliminate traditional security vulnerabilities
* **Use Public Variables Intentionally** Mark configuration as `_PUBLIC` only when transparency benefits users (e.g., API endpoints, version numbers)
* **Handle Secrets Carefully** Once secrets are decrypted inside the TEE, treat them as plaintext - avoid logging or exfiltrating them
* **Keep Dependencies Updated** Regularly update your container dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
* **Test Locally First** Develop and test your application logic thoroughly before deploying to TEE infrastructure

## Don'ts

* **Don't Log Secrets** Never log the TEE mnemonic, private keys, or decrypted environment variables
* **Don't Expose Secrets via APIs** Ensure your application doesn't inadvertently expose secrets through API responses or error messages
* **Don't Trust All Container Images** Only use trusted base images from official sources - remember your container is publicly auditable
* **Don't Rely Solely on TEE** TEE protects against infrastructure attacks but doesn't eliminate application-level vulnerabilities like SQL injection

# Threat Model

## What TEE/KMS Architecture Protects Against

| Attack Vector | Protection |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| **Malicious Cloud Providers** | EigenLabs cannot access your TEE memory or runtime data. However, in the current Mainnet Alpha, EigenLabs has access to KMS keys and can theoretically decrypt environment variables. This will be addressed in future releases with a hardened external KMS system. |
| **Infrastructure Compromise** | Even if host machines are compromised, TEE hardware isolation prevents secret extraction |
| **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks** | Encrypted secrets can only be decrypted inside verified TEE instances via [attestation](https://docs.trustauthority.intel.com/main/articles/articles/ita/concept-attestation-overview.html) |
| **Secret Exfiltration by Operators** | [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md) cryptographically binds secrets to your specific TEE. In the Mainnet Alpha, EigenLabs has KMS key access. Future releases will eliminate this access through an external hardened system. |
| **Credential Theft from Storage** | Secrets stored encrypted on-chain and in KMS, never in plaintext outside your TEE |
| **Supply Chain Attacks on Infrastructure** | [Attestation](https://docs.trustauthority.intel.com/main/articles/articles/ita/concept-attestation-overview.html) ensures only genuine TEE hardware with verified measurements can decrypt secrets |

## What TEE/KMS Does NOT Protect Against

| Attack Vector | Mitigation |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| **Vulnerable Application Code** | Review and test your code for traditional vulnerabilities (injection attacks, XSS, etc.) |
| **Secrets Logged by Your App** | Implement proper logging hygiene - never log sensitive values |
| **Compromised Dependencies** | Audit your dependencies and use trusted sources for packages |
| **Side-Channel Attacks** | While TEEs mitigate many side-channels, be cautious with timing-sensitive operations |
| **Physical Access Attacks** | TEE protects against remote attacks but sophisticated physical access could theoretically compromise hardware |
| **Malicious Container Images** | You control your container - ensure you build from trusted base images and scan for vulnerabilities |

## Security Boundaries

* **Trust Boundary** You trust the TEE hardware manufacturer ([Intel TDX](https://github.com/intel/tdx-module)) and the [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md) [attestation](https://docs.trustauthority.intel.com/main/articles/articles/ita/concept-attestation-overview.html) process
* **Your Responsibility** Application logic, dependency security, and secret handling within your code
* **Platform Responsibility** Infrastructure security, TEE provisioning, and [KMS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms/blob/master/kms.md) operation

# tls-keygen — deterministic TLS for TEE

Deterministically derive **ACME account** + **TLS** keys from a BIP-39 mnemonic, obtain a public cert via ACME, and persist the cert via a **certificate storage service**. Designed for stateless TEE instances.

## What it gives us

* **Deterministic keys**: same mnemonic (+ domain \[+ version]) → same ACME account key + TLS key.
* **Stateless TEE**: no local persistence; TLS key is derived in-enclave each boot.
* **Persistent storage**: cert chain (`fullchain.pem`) stored via API that validates GCE instance identity.
* **Survives upgrades**: certificates persist when instances are replaced during upgrades.
* **Caddy-ready**: writes `/run/tls/fullchain.pem` + `/run/tls/privkey.pem`.

## How it works

1. **Derive**

   * ACME account key: HKDF(seed, `"eigenx/acme-account/v1"`).
   * TLS key: HKDF(seed, `"eigenx/tls-key/v1"+domain[+version]`).
2. **Fetch or issue**

   * Call storage API: `GET /certs/<domain>`.
     API validates GCE instance identity token.
   * If valid → write `/run/tls/*`.
   * If missing/expiring → issue via ACME (HTTP-01 or TLS-ALPN-01), then `POST` new cert to storage API.
3. **Serve**

   * Caddy consumes `/run/tls/*` (no ACME in Caddy).

## Storage API contract

* **Auth**: requires GCE instance identity token (header: `X-Instance-Token`).
* **API endpoints**:

  * `GET /certs/<domain>` → fetch stored cert
  * `POST /certs/<domain>` → store new cert
* **Back-end storage**: certificates stored indexed by instance name and domain.

## Storage structure

```
certs/<instance_name>/<domain>/
  ├── cert.pem
  └── metadata.json
```

* `<instance_name>` = stable GCE instance name (e.g., `tee-0x123...`)
* Certificates persist across instance upgrades

## Boot sequence (per instance)

1. Derive TLS key from mnemonic.
2. Fetch GCE identity token from metadata server.
3. **GET** cert via storage API; if valid → write `/run/tls` → start app → start Caddy.
4. If missing/expiring: issue via ACME, `POST` cert to storage API → write `/run/tls`.
5. Optional renew loop: if cert < N days to expiry, re-issue and update via storage API.

## Caddy (external cert mode)

```caddy
{$DOMAIN} {
  tls /run/tls/fullchain.pem /run/tls/privkey.pem
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:{$APP_PORT:3000}
}
:80 {
  redir https://{host}{uri} permanent
  handle /health { respond "OK" 200 }
}
```

## ACME notes

* Prefer **TLS-ALPN-01** (requires 443 free before Caddy starts).
  Use **HTTP-01** only if 80 is externally reachable / DNAT’d correctly.
* Using the **same derived account key** enables \~30-day **authorization reuse** (fewer challenges).
* Keep the ACME `certificate` URL if you want easy re-download (doesn’t count against issuance).

## Troubleshooting

* **Connection refused during ACME** → wrong port binding (e.g., external 80 → container 8080); bind solver to the effective container port or use TLS-ALPN-01.
* **Caddy "failed to start" but logs show server running** → your wrapper is grepping warnings; use `caddy validate` then `caddy run` (foreground) and check exit code.
* **Certificate not found after upgrade** → check storage API is accessible and GCE identity token is being fetched correctly.

## Security

* **Mnemonic** never leaves TEE; do not log/persist it.
* **TLS private key** never stored; only derived in TEE.
* Storage contains **public** certificates only (certificates are public by design).
* Storage API authenticates via GCE instance identity tokens.
* GCE tokens are separate from CC attestation tokens (used for KMS).

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `cmd/eigenx/`: CLI entrypoint (`main.go`).
- `pkg/commands/`: Subcommands and command wiring (e.g., `app`, `auth`, `version`).
- `pkg/common/`: Shared config, flags, logging, keyring, helpers.
- `pkg/hooks/`: CLI middleware (telemetry prompt, metrics).
- `internal/`: Version info and embedded templates/bindings used at build time.
- `config/`: Embedded config (`templates.yaml`, `.gitignore`).
- `templates/`: App templates for TEE projects (golang, typescript, rust, python).
- `Makefile`: Developer tasks; output binary in `bin/eigenx`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `make help` — List tasks.
- `make build` — Build CLI to `./bin/eigenx` (injects version/commit via `-ldflags`).
- `make tests` / `make tests-fast` — Run full or quick test suites.
- `make fmt` — Format Go code with `gofmt`.
- `make lint` — Run `golangci-lint` (also wired via pre-commit).
- Run locally: `./bin/eigenx --help`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Go 1.24; keep code `gofmt`-clean and `golangci-lint`-clean.
- Packages: short, lowercase names; files `snake_case.go`.
- Exported identifiers: `CamelCase` with GoDoc-style comments.
- Prefer context-aware APIs (`ctx context.Context` first arg).
- Keep commands small and composable under `pkg/commands/...`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Frameworks: standard `testing` + `stretchr/testify`.
- Place tests alongside code as `*_test.go`; use table-driven tests where sensible.
- Run: `make tests` (CI mirrors this). Keep tests hermetic; avoid network/registry calls.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Conventional Commits style (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix(app): ...`, `chore(ci): ...`).
- PRs should include: clear description, rationale, screenshots/logs for UX/CLI changes, and linked issues.
- Before pushing: `make fmt lint tests` should pass locally.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit secrets. Use `.env` locally; CLI loads dotenv when present.
- Auth keys are stored via OS keyring; prefer `eigenx auth` flows over ad‑hoc files.
- Optional: set `TELEMETRY_TOKEN` when building releases to embed telemetry key.
- Assets are embedded via `go:embed` (`embeds.go`, `config/config_embeds.go`); update paths carefully.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`eigenx` is a CLI toolkit for scaffolding, developing, and testing applications on EigenX. It's built in Go and focuses on deploying docker containers in TEEs onchain.

## Common Development Commands

### Building and Testing
```bash
# Build the CLI binary
make build

# Run all tests (may be slow)
make tests

# Run fast tests (skips slow integration tests) 
make tests-fast

# Install binary to ~/bin/ and set up shell completion
make install

# Format code
make fmt

# Run linter
make lint

# Clean up build artifacts
make clean
```

### Testing the CLI
After building, test the CLI:
```bash
./bin/eigenx --help
./bin/eigenx app --help
```

### Cross-platform Builds
```bash
# Build for specific platforms
make build/darwin-arm64
make build/darwin-amd64  
make build/linux-arm64
make build/linux-amd64

# Build all platforms
make release
```

## Architecture Overview

### CLI Command Structure

The CLI is built with `urfave/cli/v2` and organized hierarchically:
- **Main entry**: `cmd/eigenx/main.go`
- **Core commands**: All under `eigenx app` subcommand
- **Command implementations**: `pkg/commands/` directory

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `eigenx app create [name] [language]` | Create new app project from template |
| `eigenx app name <app-id\|name> [new-name]` | Set, change, or remove a friendly name for your app |
| `eigenx app deploy [image_ref]` | Build, push, deploy to TEE |
| `eigenx app upgrade <app-id\|name> <image_ref>` | Upgrade existing deployment |
| `eigenx app start [app-id\|name]` | Start stopped app (start GCP instance) |
| `eigenx app stop [app-id\|name]` | Stop running app (stop GCP instance) |
| `eigenx app terminate [app-id\|name]` | Terminate app (terminate GCP instance) |
| `eigenx app list` | List all deployed apps |
| `eigenx app info [app-id\|name]` | Show detailed app information |
| `eigenx app logs [app-id\|name]` | View logs |

## Interactive Parameters

Optional parameters are requested interactively when not provided:

- **`name`**: Prompts if not provided and not detectable from current directory
- **`language`**: Prompts with selection list if not provided to `create`
- **`app-id|name`**: Prompts with list of available apps if not provided
- **`image_ref`**: Prompts if not provided during deploy/upgrade

### Context Detection

Commands auto-detect project context when run in directory containing `Dockerfile`. Makes `name` parameter optional for: `deploy`.

Commands also support app name resolution - you can use either the full app ID (0x123...) or a friendly name you've set with `eigenx app name`.

### Configuration System
Global configuration with XDG Base Directory compliance:

**Global Config** (`~/.config/eigenx/config.yaml`): User preferences and settings
- `FirstRun`: Tracks if this is the user's first time running eigenx
- `TelemetryEnabled`: User's global telemetry preference  
- `UserUUID`: Unique identifier for telemetry tracking

The global config uses XDG Base Directory specification, falling back to `~/.config` if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set. Configuration is automatically created with defaults on first run.

### Template System Architecture
Projects are scaffolded from Git-based templates supporting multiple languages (TypeScript, Python, etc.). Templates include:
- Dockerfile and container configuration
- Environment variable setup (.env.example)
- Sample application code
- Build and deployment configuration

### Package Organization
- **`pkg/commands/`**: CLI command implementations
- **`pkg/common/`**: Shared utilities, configuration, contracts, logging
- **`pkg/template/`**: Git-based template management
- **`pkg/telemetry/`**: PostHog analytics integration  
- **`pkg/migration/`**: Configuration migration system
- **`pkg/hooks/`**: Command lifecycle hooks

## Key Dependencies

- **Go 1.23.6+** required
- **Compute TEE contracts**: `github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-contracts`
- **Compute TEE KMS**: `github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-kms`
- **External tools**: Docker, Foundry

## Development Environment Setup

1. Install prerequisites: Docker, Foundry, Go 1.23.6+, make, jq, yq
2. Clone repository and run `make install`

## Testing Patterns

- Unit tests use standard Go testing
- Integration tests may require Docker and external dependencies
- Use `make tests-fast` for quick feedback during development
- Integration tests in `test/integration/` directory

## Configuration Migration

When adding new configuration fields:
1. Update config structs in `pkg/common/`
2. Create migration in `config/configs/migrations/` or `config/contexts/migrations/`
3. Update embedded config versions in `config/`
4. Test migration with existing project configs

## Telemetry System

Optional PostHog-based telemetry with:
- Global opt-in/opt-out
- Privacy-conscious data collection
- CI environment auto-detection (defaults to disabled)

# EigenX CLI

**Deploy verifiable applications in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**

EigenX lets you deploy containerized applications that run in secure, verifiable compute environments with built-in private key management. Your apps get a unique wallet they control, enabling autonomous onchain actions while keeping secrets safe.

## Prerequisites

- **Allowlisted Account** - Required to create apps. Use existing address with `eigenx auth login` or generate with `eigenx auth generate`. Submit an onboarding request [here](https://onboarding.eigencloud.xyz).
- **Docker** - To package and publish application images ([Download](https://www.docker.com/get-started/))
- **Sepolia ETH** - For deployment transactions ([Google Cloud Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) | [Alchemy Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/))

## Mainnet Alpha Limitations
- **Not recommended for customer funds** - Mainnet Alpha is intended to enable developers to build, test and ship applications. We do not recommend holding significant customer funds at this stage in Mainnet Alpha.
- **Developer is still trusted** - Mainnet Alpha does not enable full verifiable and trustless execution. A later version will ensure developers can not upgrade code maliciously, and liveness guarantees.
- **No SLA** - Mainnet Alpha does not have SLAs around support, and uptime of infrastructure. 

## **Quick Start**

### **Installation**

#### macOS/Linux
```bash
curl -fsSL https://eigenx-scripts.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/install-eigenx.sh | bash
```

#### Windows
```bash
curl -fsSL https://eigenx-scripts.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/install-eigenx.ps1 | powershell -
```

### Initial Setup 
```bash
# Log in to your Docker registry (required to push images)
docker login

# Log in with an existing private key
eigenx auth login
```

**Don't have a private key?** Use `eigenx auth generate --store` instead

**Need Sepolia ETH?** Run `eigenx auth whoami` to see your address, then get funds from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) or [Alchemy](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)

### **Create & Deploy**

```bash
# Create your app (choose: typescript | python | golang | rust)
eigenx app create my-app typescript
cd my-app

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Deploy to TEE
eigenx app deploy
```

### **Working with Existing Projects**

Have an existing project? You don't need `eigenx app create` - the CLI works with any Docker-based project:

```bash
# From your existing project directory
cd my-existing-project

# Ensure you have a Dockerfile and .env file
# The CLI will prompt for these if not found in standard locations

# Deploy directly - the CLI will detect your project
eigenx app deploy
```

**What you need:**
- **Dockerfile** - Must target `linux/amd64` and run as root user
- **.env file** - For environment variables (optional but recommended)

The CLI will automatically prompt for the Dockerfile and .env paths if they're not in the default locations. This means you can use eigenx with any existing containerized application without restructuring your project.

**Need TLS/HTTPS?** Run `eigenx app configure tls` to add the necessary configuration files for domain setup with private traffic termination in the TEE.

### **View Your App**

```bash
# View app information and logs
eigenx app info
eigenx app logs

# Add --watch (or -w) to continuously poll for live updates
eigenx app info --watch
eigenx app logs --watch
```

That's it! Your starter app is now running in a TEE with access to a MNEMONIC that only it can access.

**Ready to customize?** Edit your application code, update `.env` with any API keys you need, then run `eigenx app upgrade my-app` to deploy your changes

## Application Environment

Your TEE application runs with these capabilities:

1. **Secure Execution** - Your code runs in an Intel TDX instance with hardware-level isolation
2. **Auto-Generated Wallet** - Access a private mnemonic via `process.env.MNEMONIC`
    - Derive wallet accounts using standard libraries (e.g., viem’s `mnemonicToAccount(process.env.MNEMONIC)`)
    - Only your TEE can decrypt and use this mnemonic
3. **Environment Variables** - All variables from your `.env` file are available in your container
   - Variables with `_PUBLIC` suffix are visible to users for transparency
   - Standard variables remain private and encrypted within the TEE
4. **Onchain Management** - Your app's lifecycle is controlled via Ethereum smart contracts

### Working with Your App

```bash
# List all your apps
eigenx app list

# Stop/start your app
eigenx app stop my-app
eigenx app start my-app

# Terminate your app
eigenx app terminate my-app
```

## Authentication

EigenX CLI needs a private key to sign transactions. Three options:

### 1. OS Keyring (Recommended)

```bash
eigenx auth generate --store # Generate new key and store it
eigenx auth login            # Store an existing key securely
eigenx auth whoami           # Check authentication
eigenx auth logout           # Remove key
```

### 2. Environment Variable

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234...
eigenx app deploy
```

### 3. Command Flag

```bash
eigenx app deploy --private-key 0x1234...
```

**Priority:** Flag → Environment → Keyring

## TLS/HTTPS Setup

### Enable TLS

```bash
# Add TLS configuration to your project
eigenx app configure tls

# Add variables to .env
cat .env.example.tls >> .env
```

### Configure

Required in `.env`:
```bash
DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
APP_PORT=3000
```

Recommended for first deployment:
```bash
ENABLE_CADDY_LOGS=true  # Debug logs
ACME_STAGING=true       # Test certificates (avoid rate limits)
```

### DNS Setup

Create A record pointing to instance IP:
- Type: A
- Name: yourdomain.com
- Value: `<instance-ip>` (get from `eigenx app info`)

### Deploy

```bash
eigenx app upgrade
```

### Production Certificates

To switch from staging to production:
```bash
# Set in .env:
ACME_STAGING=false
ACME_FORCE_ISSUE=true  # Only if staging cert exists

# Deploy, then set ACME_FORCE_ISSUE=false for future deploys
```

**Notes:**
- Let's Encrypt rate limit: 5 certificates/week per domain
- Test with staging certificates first to avoid rate limits
- DNS changes may take a few minutes to propagate

## Advanced Usage

### Building and Pushing Images Manually

If you prefer to build and push Docker images yourself instead of letting the CLI handle it, or already have an existing image:

```bash
# Build and push your image manually
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t myregistry/myapp:v1.0 .
docker push myregistry/myapp:v1.0

# Deploy using the image reference
eigenx app deploy myregistry/myapp:v1.0
```

**Requirements:**

- Image must target `linux/amd64` architecture
- Application must run as root user (TEE requirement)

## Telemetry

EigenX collects anonymous usage data to help us improve the CLI and understand how it's being used. This telemetry is enabled by default but can be easily disabled.

### What We Collect

- Commands used (e.g., `eigenx app create`, `eigenx app deploy`)
- Error counts and types to identify common issues
- Performance metrics (command execution times)
- System information (OS, architecture)
- Deployment environment (e.g., sepolia, mainnet-alpha)
- User Ethereum address

### What We DON'T Collect

- Personal information or identifiers
- Private keys or sensitive credentials
- Application source code or configurations
- Specific file paths or project names

### Managing Telemetry

```bash
# Check current telemetry status
eigenx telemetry --status

# Disable telemetry
eigenx telemetry --disable

# Re-enable telemetry
eigenx telemetry --enable
```

Telemetry settings are stored globally and persist across all projects.

## Architecture

For a detailed understanding of how EigenX enables verifiable applications with deterministic identities, see our [Architecture Documentation](docs/EIGENX_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Key Components

- **Hardware Isolation** - Intel TDX secure enclaves with memory encryption
- **Attestation** - Cryptographic proof of exact Docker image integrity
- **Deterministic Keys** - Apps receive consistent identities via KMS
- **Smart Contracts** - Onchain configuration and lifecycle management

## Development

Build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-cli
cd eigenx-cli
make build              # Builds for development (default)
GO_TAGS=prod make build # Builds for production
./bin/eigenx --help
```

Run tests:
```bash
make tests        # Full test suite
make tests-fast   # Quick tests only
```

## Release Process

### Local Template Development

For testing template changes locally without pushing to GitHub:

1. Clone the templates repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenx-templates
```

2. Use local templates with environment variables:
```bash
# From the eigenx-cli directory or one level above
EIGENX_USE_LOCAL_TEMPLATES=true ./bin/eigenx app create test-app typescript

# Or specify the path explicitly
EIGENX_TEMPLATES_PATH=/path/to/eigenx-templates EIGENX_USE_LOCAL_TEMPLATES=true eigenx app create test-app golang
```

This uses templates from your local `eigenx-templates/` directory instead of fetching from GitHub.

## License

### Dev Releases

For testing new features before production:

```bash
# Tag with dev suffix and incremental build number
git tag v0.1.0-dev.1
git push origin v0.1.0-dev.1

# Found a bug? Increment the build number
git tag v0.1.0-dev.2
git push origin v0.1.0-dev.2
```

This deploys to the dev environment and can be installed with:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://eigenx-scripts.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/install-eigenx.sh | bash -s -- --dev
```

### Production Releases

After testing in dev, promote to production:

```bash
# Promotes the latest v0.1.0-dev.* version to production
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

This:
- Verifies a dev version exists (e.g., `v0.1.0-dev.2`)
- Copies the **exact same binary** from dev to production
- Creates a GitHub release
- Updates the stable installation channel

Users get the promoted version with:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://eigenx-scripts.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/install-eigenx.sh | bash
```

### Key Benefits

- **Build once**: Same binary promoted from dev to prod
- **Safety**: Cannot release untested code to production
- **Coexistence**: `eigenx-dev` and `eigenx` can both be installed
- **Clean versions**: Production gets clean version numbers (v0.1.0)
- **Easy rollback**: Tag any previous version for instant rollback

### Installation Channels

- **Development**: `--dev` flag installs as `eigenx-dev`
- **Production**: Default installation installs as `eigenx`

Both versions can coexist on the same system.
